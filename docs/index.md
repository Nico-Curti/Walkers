The Walkers toolbox provides a set of optimization algorithms and random walk process inspired by natural process and physical equations. The package also includes a set of common score functions (landscape) to study the characteristics of each walkers and the pro and cons of each optimization strategy.

The Walkers project is inspired by the [EvoloPy](https://github.com/7ossam81/EvoloPy) project and it is proposed as an optimization and extension of that.
